StockEd is a group project created for UCLA's CS35L spring 2021 course. It is a fun, interactive web app that helps users of all ages develop financial literacy by mimicking the fluctuations of the stock market and allowing users to simulate realistic experiences in the stock market without having to suffer the potential financial consequences.

# Usage
To run StockEd, here are the steps you should take.
1. First clone the repo to your local drive, either using something like Github Desktop or by running `git clone https://github.com/xu-jerry/stock-ed.git` in the directory you want the repo to be in.
2. Navigate into the directory by running `cd stock-ed`.
2. In the same directory, run `npm install`. Make sure you have installed both Node and npm!
3. Next, run `npm run dev` in the same folder.

Now, your website should be visible at http://localhost:3000. Check out the about page, create an account and log in to see more of the features! Congrats on taking your first step to greater financial literacy.
